# Memory Game

## Game Rules
- The deck is made up of eight different pairs of cards, each with different symbols on one side.
- The cards are arranged randomly on the grid with the symbol face down.
- The gameplay rules are very simple: flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the ones that match!
