Memory Matching Game

The game:
- By clicking on the first card, you start the game (the timer).
- The idea is that you should match each two similar cards cards.
- The rating system depends on the number of moves (two clicks) you took to match all pairs.
- 3 stars: If less than or equal to 12.
- 2 stars: If less than or equal to 16.
- 1 star: If less than or equal to 20.
- No stars if larger than that :'D.

Dependencies: 
- For the font, I used a cartoonish typeface from Google fonts:
